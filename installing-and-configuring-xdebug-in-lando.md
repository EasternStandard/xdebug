# Installing and Configuring XDebug in Lando

The Lando documentation contains [an excellent tutorial](https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/lando-with-vscode.html) on configuring XDebug within Lando and then setting up VSCode properly. Remember that you need to have the following in your `.lando.yml` file:

```yaml
config:
  xdebug: true
```
